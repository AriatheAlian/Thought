I’ve started writing a commentary on *The Garden*. When I need to get something out quickly, I use Chinese. Maybe Chinese isn’t the most precise language, but it is my mother tongue. I hate it, but I also rely on it. Whenever I write in Chinese, I feel constrained—as if my thoughts are being forced into some rigid structure. Instead of flowing freely like a stream, they stumble out, bead by bead, like assembling a bracelet. That’s why I’m saying this now—if I don’t write it down, I’ll forget what *The Garden* was even about.

In fact, many coherent thoughts have already slipped away from my mind. No more digressions.

*The Garden* is easier to understand than *The Last of England*. I still approached it mostly to watch Jarman’s visuals without much hope of interpreting them. But compared to *The Last of England*, *The Garden* is much richer in symbols and metaphors. Where *The Last of England* used blurred imagery and intense colors to hint at postwar cultural decay and psychic disarray, *The Garden* is more interested in telling a story. To borrow T.S. Eliot’s view of literature: structure lies between sentences, and it’s the thought embedded in that structure that makes literature great. If *The Last of England* is a watercolor, then *The Garden* is a jigsaw puzzle—each frame connects to another layer of meaning, forming a three-dimensional idea.

Thinking about it now, though I didn’t notice it at first, the Biblical references in *The Garden* remind me of *The Waste Land* in more ways than one.

Ideally, I’d rewatch the film while writing about it, but I’m on mobile data, and every film I watch feels like I’m spending something. So now I rely on memory and screenshots to piece things together.

*The Garden* started making more sense when I saw Jarman himself tending plants in the garden. I’ve always liked this blurring of boundaries between art and life. Jarman’s gardening acts as a metaphor for constructing a world—filming the movie itself—and becomes a pivot that shifts the film back and forth between dream and reality. And within each metaphor lies another. The garden as a structure reflects reality, but within the film itself, there’s a contrast between reality and dream. (I now realize I should’ve started from the inner parts and worked outward to the overall structure.)

For example: Jarman sleeps in the center of water, four people with torches standing around him. The wind lifts the sheet that covers his body, spreading the whiteness. Water spreads too. He’s sleeping at a desk. Water drips onto it.

The symbolism is rich here, though I can’t decode it all. The torches show up in other scenes too: dark figures persecuting men in drag, naked people driving others away, and men surrounding Jesus. The torch implies a kind of “threat of violence,” but not actual physical harm. It’s like the fear of public opinion—something that doesn’t touch your skin but wounds all the same. If these scenes are Jarman’s dream, then maybe he’s trying to say the threat persists even in sleep. Torches gave rise to shame, which birthed civilization, and civilization then used language to reconstruct shame and turn it into violence against sexual minorities.

So for me, the torch isn’t just about expulsion—it’s about **projected shame**.

There’s this beautiful pairing of pleasant and disturbing imagery in *The Garden* that helps with interpretation. A kiss between two gay men on a beach—it’s so romantic. Tilda holds a child; the scene feels peaceful, full of warmth. But at the beginning, we see her being filmed in despair, fleeing, her child abandoned. Is motherhood just something to be sensationalized? The Madonna must be filmed, criticized, sexualized—but life itself is forgotten. Faith has long collapsed in modern society; no one looks toward Jesus anymore. Media is the new god.

Later in the film, Jesus walks alone through the sunset landscape, past factories and barren earth. No one turns to him. No one believes. Behind him, only the skeleton of transmission towers.

Before the “garden” part begins, Jarman films a woman in pink repeating ad slogans, invoking female autonomy while pushing pink as the right choice for women. The gay couple also wears pink and holds a child. This feels like a jab at the advertising industry, though I’m not sure how to interpret it regarding the men—maybe it critiques feminine stereotypes?

One of my favorite scenes comes after we enter the garden: Tilda sits in a sea of purple flowers, quietly enjoying the sunlight. That’s it. This is the garden—Jarman’s garden—and this is Tilda, an embodiment of beauty.

The earth is whipped into rotation. Time is forced forward. A child is learning the truths of the world. The philosophers.

Jarman lies on a desk. In his room there’s a crucifix, a figure of Christ.

A man kisses Jesus, beneath the torches.

In Jarman’s vision, the gay world is pure, childlike, still full of faith. Children toss feathers during a pillow fight—those same feathers are used later to humiliate, smeared with blood on the men’s faces. The cries for truth from the philosophers eventually land as lashes on their backs.

They suffer because they love. They carry their crosses up the hill.

A gay man dies.

At the end of the film, Jarman closes a book—his labor is done. Tilda arrives with food. They eat, then roll up the paper wrapping into candle-like shapes and light them. The paper burns to ash, drifting straight upward.

Everything floats away.
